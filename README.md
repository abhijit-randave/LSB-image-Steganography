# LSB-image-Steganography
This project demonstrates image steganography by embedding secret text data inside image files without noticeable distortion. It focuses on data hiding, file handling, and bit-level manipulation using C programming
🔐 Steganography Project

Steganography is the technique of hiding secret information within non-secret data such as images, audio, or video files.
This project implements image-based steganography to securely hide and retrieve secret messages from image files.
